TT5 Model: A Text-to-Text Transformer 
Overview
This repository implements a T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model from scratch, allowing you to perform various NLP tasks such as translation, summarization, question answering, and more. The implementation uses PyTorch and Hugging Face's Transformers library, with the flexibility to train on custom datasets.

Features
Customizable T5 model implementation using PyTorch.
Handles diverse NLP tasks as text-to-text problems.
Easy integration with real-world datasets using Hugging Face's Datasets library.
Extensible architecture for custom tasks and datasets.

Install the required dependencies 
pip install torch transformers datasets
